# AR Experiences
### Artivive

>### Description of Experience
Artivive seems like an interesting gimmick to increase audience participation with a work of art. My experience uses an image from Neon Genesis Evangelion and when scanned it plays a video of a character, Shinji, having a mental breakdown. For people who have seen the show, connecting these two dots is natural and those out of the loop won’t make the connection quite as easily. This interaction between the audience and the piece dependent on prior knowledge creates a different experience which is interesting. This type of technology feels like it could easily be used for comedy purposes by playing with a viewer’s expectation of what comes next and subverting it. One person I had test this had no prior knowledge of Neon Genesis Evangelion and did not understand why the video would have played after while the other immediately understood.

### OrBeat (Turn down sound)

>### Description of Experience
I created a small looping song with Orbeat and liked ability to drop sound nodes and immediately hear how it changed the song. Using touch controls the user could manipulate how each node interacted with the sound radar as it reached the node. The distance between the node and the center also altered the sound played. This application could be used for people with no experience to explore making songs and how sounds interact. The space required to utilize Orbeat is large, the application is janky, and the exported sounds are not representative of the song in the application. I had someone make the song with me and they liked the idea but thought the implantation was poor from the developers.
