## Markers
---
As Augmented Reality has advanced as have the methods of creating markers to track objects in the environment. Some of the more consistent (read: less janky) markers are reliant on a preset square frame that can be used to project the AR object onto. Often this type of marker will incorporate a predetermined image/QRcode/nft that reduces the amount of processing needed to project an AR object into space. The reliability of this type of marker comes with the limitation that the frame needs to be present for the AR to function. More advanced types of markers will scan the space and update the frame depending on the distance between the camera and the surroundings which allows for AR objects to be projected on any flat surface but this requires much more processing and the tracking will be lost more often. Usually pretty janky but the technology is improving.
