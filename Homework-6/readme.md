WebAR Test- https://xr.plus/jtr


This week we learned about web-based AR application software which has a lower learning curve than using Unity. Using XR+ I was able to display a simple model and an image below it. Utilizing web browsers allows for easy distribution of an AR experience since everyone with a phone has a browser installed. The purpose of my application is to have a model that I practice drawing from different angles. Having the ability to move around a model in 3D space allows for interesting angles and drawing challenges without having to find reference material for the specific angle Iâ€™m looking for.

I sent the link to a friend and they were unable to view it using their default browser on their phone, but it worked when they used chrome. The model was visible and they were able to resize it as needed. They needed to completely close the browser and reopen it every time they wanted to view the model because the camera would not activate if it was previously opened.
