## AR Utility

Wide adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) feels like an unlikely sci-fi concept to most people because they might not see value presented in the technology without realizing that they’ve utilized the technology already. The most common usage is through phone applications using the onboard camera to scan the space and place an object that can be interacted with. These types of interactions are for entertainment purposes primarily, though some are for demonstrating a product’s dimensions realistically in your physical space. I feel as though AR has so much more untapped potential than these simple interactions and we are on the precipice of a breakthrough in the space. I think the most value of AR will come from virtual appspace displayed in 3D around the user.

These virtual appspaces will be mostly used for media consumption and communication as that is the most common usage of smartphones currently. The user will be able to have a floating chat log in their environment that they can access at any time while simultaneously working on several other windows. I think of it as a pc poweruser who has 4 monitors available for work, but in AR the number of windows is limitless and the user is not restricted to a physical space, they can work anywhere. This is where I see AR having the most utility in the very near future.
